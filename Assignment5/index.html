      The bags in which students carry their school materials are known as school backpacks. It is an essential element of a student's life. School bags have become a symbol of a student's identity at school. Latest school backpacks come in various colours and designs.Bags have been attested for thousands of years, and bags have also been used by men, women, and children of all ages. Bags have been prevalent as far back as Ancient Egypt. Many hieroglyphs depict males with bags tied around their waists. Bags encasing cosmetic sticks from the Bronze Age, around 2000 BCE, have been excavated in the Xiaohe Cemetery in China.[3] The Bible mentions pouches, especially with regard to Judas Iscariot carrying one around, holding his personal items, in the first century. In the 14th century, wary of pickpockets and thieves, many people used drawstring bags to carry their money. These bags were attached to girdles via a long cord fastened to the waist.
The Australian dillybag is a traditional Australian Aboriginal bag generally woven from plant fibres. Dillybags were and are mainly designed and used by women to gather and transport food, and are most commonly found in the northern parts of Australia.[4]
Although paper had been used for wrapping and padding in Ancient China since the 2nd century BC,[5] the first use of paper bags in China (for preserving the flavor of tea) came during the later Tang dynasty (618â€“907 AD).[5]
